# Recipebox

Emily's notes: 
RecipeBox Prototype requirements: 

White-label receipes web app with a quick turnaround time. Give the client a feel for the web app. 
Needs to: 
Browse list of recipes 
Add + remove recipes on their bookmark list 
Allow the user to open and close their list using top right toggle button 

Intiial thoughts/ questions from the design:

When I click bookmark adds it to the list, is the bookmark icon then coloured out? 
If I then click the same bookmark icon again is it removed from the basket? 
Even, simple styling throughout. 
Number increases when you bookmark, decreases when you remove a recipe from the list. When 0 recipes are bookmarked, is 0 shown or just no number? 
Recipebox title and bookmark icon top bar sticky/ always visible
When the bookmark list is open can you still save on the page? Or if you click elsewhere on the page will the bookmark popup close? 


Deciding to use a flexBox method so that the laptop of the recipe sqaures is responsive to the browser/ screen being used. e.g. phone to laptop 
Testing this style by using inspect, dev tools toggle element to view the layout of differnt screens.


Missing requirements/ ran out of time to do: 
Saved recipes counter 


Things that need fixing pre handover: 

Modal close button needs to be displyed in a clear format.-done 
The remove buttons in the modal need to be dispalyed to the right/end.
Saved recipes modal title centred and the line below full length.- done


Header icon needs to be styled differently to the recipe bookmark icons 

If I add loads of recipes to the bookmark tab, when you view the modal it takes up the whole screen and you cannot get to the close button without removing some recipes. Instead impliment a scroll feature for the saved recipes. 
The recipe list titles need to fit the size of the image squares so that the bookmark buttons are all still alligned. This is especially important if viewing on mobile. 

Tried to add mobile styling, which did help with the images however need to look at the sizing of the modal etc

Dev testing: 
when viewing on mobile can you still see the saved recipes icon in the header 
when viewing on mobile does the remove button go under the title in the modal? 
check on different browsers, chrome, safari etc
